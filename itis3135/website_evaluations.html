                <h3> <a href="https://www.lingscars.com/">Ling's Cars - not so great</a> </h3>
                <p> Ling's Cars' website displays all the different types of Cars that Ling sells. There is a lot going on in every spot
                    on the website. This makes it hard to navigate.
                </p>

                <h4>Contrast</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's there, but the screen is so busy, it makes contrast seem like a stranger</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Repetition</h4>
                <ul>

                    <ul>List of car brands on the left side is overdone...</ul>
                    <li>Car titles are all the same font, color</li>
                    <li>Repeating things too much - also due to too many cars on the front page</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Alignment</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The entire page is within a single box, centered in the viewport</li>
                    <ul>Business info section (orange gradient box) includes centered p elements :(</ul>
                    <li>In fact, every time a p element is featured, it is centered.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Proximity</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Everything is way too close to each other</li>
                    <ul>Images are too close to each other, and too large due to many unnecessary captions</ul>
                </ul>

                I, <a href="./index.html">John Thornton</a> agree to abide
                by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2024 ITIS3135, Web-Application Development Class with my instructor,
                Professor D.I. von Briesen
            </p>

            <p>
                I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world,
                and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.
                As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples
                online or even view my classmates’ code directly.
                I swear that I will only use these resources to learn,
                and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
            </p>

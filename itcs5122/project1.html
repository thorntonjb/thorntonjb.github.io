			<h2>Avocado Growth in California Over 40 Years</h2>
			<p>
				Avocado growth in California is not something that California is necessarily known for. However, all avocados need is a hot climate to grow.
			</p>

			<img src="./images/california-yields.png" alt="Line plot of Yields of California Avocado Farms between 1980 and 2020" />
			<p>The graph above shows a general upward trend in Avocado yields over 40 years. These are measured in tons.</p>

			<img src="./images/california-produced.png" alt="Line plot of number of avocados produced in California between 1980 and 2020" />
			<p>With this graph, we only see a slight upward trend (and even some stagnance) in avocado production across all California counties.</p>
			<p>What does this mean with our data? It may mean that our avocados are getting denser. There's <strong>more</strong> avocado per avocado</p>
			<p>
				Though the trend of avocado production seems stagnant, you can still see the relevance between the two features. Spikes and dips correlate
				between the two plots.
